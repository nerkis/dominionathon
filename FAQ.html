				<strong>Who should attend?</strong>
				<p>Do you like Dominion?  Then you should come.  Do you like winning trohies?  Then you should come.  Do you like testing your skills against <br>local people who share your interests?  Then you should come.  Do you want to sharpen your skills and learn some new tricks?  Then you <br>should come.  Do you just want to play a lot of Dominion with local people who share the same interests as you?  Then you should come.<br><br>Please not that since Dominionathon is a BYOB event, you must be at least 21 years old to attend.</p><br>


				<h3>Registration</h3><br>
				<strong>How do I register?</strong>
				<p>You can register <a href="register.html">here</a> on our website, or at the door at the event.<br><br>
				Early registration is highly recommended as space is limited to the first 100 registrants.  (Note:  RSVP-ing on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/445466062284414/">Facebook page</a> -- although<br> highly encouraged -- is not the same thing as registering, which can only be done via this <a href="register.html">link</a> or at the door, if space is still available.)  If you<br> would like to register but are unable to use Paypal, please contact us at <a href="mailto:dominionathon@gmail.com">dominionathon@gmail.com</a> to make alternative arrangements. </p><br>
				
				<strong>How much does it cost?</strong>
				<p>Registration costs $15 until July 5th. After that and at the door, registration will cost $20.</p><br>
				<strong>What am I paying for?</strong>
				<p>Great Question!  Your registration fee grants you all-day access to the event/facility and an opportunity to hoist your very own Dominionathon<br> trophy!  There will be ample opportunity to compete in many rounds of Dominion before we start culling the herd.  And even if you eventually do get<br> eliminated from competition, our 100+ game open-gaming library will ensure that the fun doesn't stop till midnight! </p>
