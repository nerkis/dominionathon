				<h3>Tournament Structure</h3>
				<p>The tournament will be composed of two stages as follows, with
			    the caveat that actual format is subject to player turnout and 
			    other factors.</p><br>
				<strong>Open Stage</strong>
				<p>At this stage, all players will have the opportunity to compete in five to six four-player matches (three-player matches will be used as <br>necessary based on headcount). At the outset of each round of matches, players will receive a random playing card. The playing card <br>will determine the participants in each match as well as the station at which that match will occur. Each station will have its own set of <br>Dominion cards with most stations being a blend of two different sets as shown below. Players are free to play in as many or as few <br>Open Stage matches as they choose. However, participation in as many as possible is highly encouraged insofar as advancement to <br>the Playoff Stage will be based on total points accumulated during the Open Stage.</p><br>
				<strong>Playoff Stage</strong>
				<p>The concept behind the Playoff Stage is to advance the top 40% - 50% of the Open Stage field to a series of (probably about 3) four-<br>player elimination matches. The exact structure of the Playoff Stage will be determined on the day of the event based on actual <br>headcount and score distribution from the Open Stage. This stage will culminate in a four-player final table to see who wins the trophy <br>and which of you bitches comes in second.</p><br>
				<strong>Potential Station Setups</strong><br><br>

				<p>** The kingdom setup at each station should be determined by dealing out ten randomizer cards. By unanimous consent, the table <br>may decide to deal out fourteen randomizer cards and allow each player one veto.  Whatever method you choose, remember Rule <br>No. 4, below.</p><br>
				<strong>Scoring</strong>
				<p>Finishing position in each game will be determined using the following rules:<br><br>
			    1. Highest number of Victory Points<br>
			    2. Latest in turn order. There are no ties.<br><br>
			    Players will receive Advancement Points based on their performance in each game. In a four-player match, Advancement Points <br>shall be assigned as follows: 8/5/2/0. For a three-player match: 8/5/0. These scoring rules match the 2015 WBC format.</p><br>

				<h3>Miscellaneous Rules</h3>
				<p>1. Dominionathon is a gentleman's game. All rules should be interpreted in that light.</p>
				<p>2. Tournament rules trump the rulebook. Otherwise, the rulebook controls.</p>
				<p>3. The members of each table shall be responsible for officiating disputes that may arise from time to time regarding the application <br>of any rules. To the extent a dispute cannot be resolved amicably within the table, recourse may be had to a tournament organizer, <br>whose judgement shall be final. Given the need to keep the tournament moving, this remedy should be used sparingly.</p>
				<p>4. All players are responsible for keeping the tournament moving at an acceptable pace. All efforts should be made to limit match <br>length to 45 minutes, particularly during the Open Stage. If a match is still ongoing at the 45-minute mark, an additional 5 minute <br>grace-period shall be given. After the expiration of the grace-period, the game is deemed over, scores are computed, and a winner <br>is assigned.</p>
				<p>5. At the end of each match, the winner should fill out the scorecard (which all players should sign) and the winner is then responsible <br>for placing that scorecard in the official Scorecard Box at the official Scorer's Table.  Failure to do so may result in those points <br>being lost forever.</p>
				<p>6. All players are responsible for keeping track of those stations at which he/she has already played. If and when a player receives <br>a random station assignment that coincides with a station he/she has already played, he/she should request a different card. <br>This is the only acceptable basis for requesting a different station assignment. For purposes of keeping things moving, the <br>player must request a different assignment card at the time the original assignment card is issued or forfeit his/her right to do so.</p>
				<p>7. Some expansions (e.g., Prosperity, Dark Ages, etc.) have "optional" cards (e.g., Colonies, Platinums, Shelters, etc.). If these <br>cards are present at your station, you should play with them; if they are not present, you should not.</p>
				<p>8. Every effort will be made to comply with these rules. However, the organizer reserves the right to amend these rules consistent <br>ith the spirit of healthy competition as the tournament progresses on a case-by-case basis. To the extent an amendment may <br>be necessary, input will be solicited, but the organizer's decision is final.</p>
